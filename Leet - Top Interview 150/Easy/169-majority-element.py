169. Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. 
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
